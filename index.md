## About Me
I am a full time student at bloomfield college but more than that I am an eager learner. I've dabbled in multiple fields in the games industry for the sake of my solo projects included and not limited to music, art, programming, and game design. While I can't claim to be good at all of those fields, I do consider myself a very competent programmer and problem solver.
