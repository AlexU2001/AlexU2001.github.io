        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a full time student at bloomfield college but more than that I am an eager learner. I've dabbled in multiple fields in the games industry for the sake of my solo projects included and not limited to music, art, programming, narrative design, and game design. While I can't claim to be good at all of those fields, I do consider myself a very competent programmer and problem solver.</p>
        <p>I am also still developing this website. This is iteration number...</p>
