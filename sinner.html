        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
            Upon starting a run of the game you will find yourself in a randomly selected map and provided with a
            procedurally generated objective, with instructions visible on the top right of your screen, which you
            must complete to advance to the next map. This usually means setting yourself ablaze and spreading the
            flames to objective exclusive objects or enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
            With each objective completed, the difficulty of the game ramps up. New enemies and objectives can be
            generated and found and the length of the objectives also increases.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the difficulty increases, so does your score. There will be two possible outcomes for any given run,
            reaching the end, and death. Your final score will be determined when either outcome comes to pass.
        </p>
        <p>
            But fear not for while the start will be difficult, great knowledge awaits those patient and strong
            enough to see it. And with great knowledge comes great power. Fragments of knowledge left behind by an
            unknown source can be found in the crucible. They will empower you.
        </p>
        <h2>Fragments of Knowledge</h2>
        <p>After completing 3 objectives, you will be transported into the realm of knowledge. Here fragments of
            unknown origin can be acquired and stacked to give you various abilities ranging from increased fire
            resistance, to a larger explosive radius, increased speed, and many other incredible power ups.
        </p>
        <p>
            Try your best to acquire them but beware as the realm of knowledge is not safe. Enemies will still spawn
            and impede your attempts to gather as many fragments as possible.
